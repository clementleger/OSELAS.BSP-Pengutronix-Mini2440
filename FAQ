mini2440 FAQ
------------

These questions came up while development of this mini2440 boad support package.

Q: I can't login
A: A bad commit changed the names of the serial consoles to 's3c2410_serial*'
   instead of 'ttySAC*'. Problem is present at least in Linux-2.6.37, solved
   in Linux-2.6.38.

Q: The NAND flash driver shows flash's content only once. After that, it reports
   zeroes only.
A: Don't use the 'Samsung S3C NAND IDLE clock stop' feature. It seems broken
   at least in the 2.6.37 kernel. Fixed in 2.6.39.

Q: Linux states "mtd: no mtd-id" while startup
A: The mtdparts parameter should not contain a trailing semicolon, as its meant
   to be as a delimiter and no end marker. Fixed. Related to the bootloader.

Q: Linux states while startup:
     gpiochip_add: gpios 288..303 (GPIOK) failed to register
     gpiochip_add: gpios 320..334 (GPIOL) failed to register
     gpiochip_add: gpios 352..353 (GPIOM) failed to register
A: The kernel tries to register more GPIO settings than the S3C2440 supports.
   Can be ignored.

Q: Linux states "nand_bbt: ECC error while reading bad block table"
A: barebox has written this BBT. So both are using a different ECC calculation.
   You probably use a barebox with broken S3C2440 NAND controller support.
   Only the barebox-2011.03.0 or later does it in a correct manner.

Q: With a working barebox I now get
     Bad block table found at page <number>, version 0x01
     Bad block table found at page <number>, version 0x01
     nand_bbt: ECC error while reading bad block table
   What's wrong now?
A: After writing the BBT with a broken NAND driver, the OOB data is now bad.
   You must erase these blocks first before re-use. TBD: How to?

Q: My jffs2 root filesystem does not work properly after writing to the NAND
A: The 64 MiB NAND needs an erase blocksize of 16 kiB, all other NANDs are
   needing a 128 kiB erase block size.

Q: Why did you modify the touch driver?
A: The mainline one is broken by design or simply racy. Just add some debug
   outputs to the touch or ADC driver and you can see it.

Generic:

Q: The 'rcS' file from ptxdist fails to mount 'sys/'
A: If you are using 'mount' and 'umount' from the 'util-linux-ng' package you
   must also setup the file '/etc/mtab' as a link to '/proc/mounts'
   (e.g. "PTXCONF_ROOTFS_MTAB_LINK_MOUNTS=y")
