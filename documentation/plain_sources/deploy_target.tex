\chapter{Bring in the Bootloader Barebox}	\label{sec:deploying}

In order to make use of all possible boot sources the bootloader Barebox must
be installed into the Mini2440. This bootloader enables the following boot
sources:

\begin{itemize}
	\item NAND flash memory: This enables the Mini2440 to boot standalone
	and very fast
	\item SD/MMC card: This enables the user to change all relevant
	software parts very easy by changing the SD/MMC card
	\item Network: This is intended for easy development
\end{itemize}

What we need for this step:

\begin{itemize}
 \item a working network infrastructure
 \item host with network and USB capabilities
 \item a working TFTP server on our host
 \item some cables
 \begin{itemize}
  \item network
  \item USB-A to USB-B
  \item RS232
 \end{itemize}
 \item serial terminal running on our host
\end{itemize}

We assume here:

\begin{itemize}
 \item the directory of the TFTP server is \texttt{/tftpboot}
 \item network is already configured for the host and the target
       (refer section \ref{sec:networkadaptions})
 \item all connections are done (network, USB, serial)
 \item the serial terminal is able to handle 8 bits at 115200 Bd
\end{itemize}

To load the kernel and rootfs images, we first must load the new bootloader.
This is the trickiest part, as we need special tools on our host and the target.
Also, we may have to deal with confusing error messages.

First of all, we must change the \textbf{S2} switch on our Mini2440
to the \texttt{NOR} position to start the internal \textit{vivi} bootloader.
After switching on the Mini2440, the vivi bootloader will greet us
with:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
##### FriendlyARM BIOS for 2440 #####
[x] bon part 0 320k 2368k
[v] Download vivi
[k] Download linux kernel
[y] Download root_yaffs image

[r] Restore NAND Flash from HOST through USB
[q] Goto shell of vivi
[i] Version: 1026-12
Enter your selection:
\end{ptxshell}

We want to use the \textit{vivi} bootloader to load the new Barebox bootloader
into the Mini2440's RAM. In order to do so, we need the size in bytes of
Barebox's binary:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
|\$| ls -l |\ptxdistPlatformDir |images/barebox-image
-rw-r--r-- 1 jb user 147844 Jun 04 23:07 |\ptxdistPlatformDir |images/barebox-image
\end{ptxshell}

The size of this binary may differ in your case. In our case here it is
\textit{147844}.

With this size we instruct the \textit{vivi} bootloader to expect this number of
bytes from the USB and store it to the internal RAM. To do so, we enter
'\textit{q}' to enter vivi's shell. Then we start the download command.

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
Enter your selection: q
Supervivi> load ram 0x31000000 147844 u
\end{ptxshell}

Please consider the \textit{147844} number here. This number must be the same
as size of your Barebox image.

At this point of time many error messages can happen. The Mini2440
may output \texttt{USB host is not connected yet}. In this case disconnect
the USB cable again, powercycle the Mini2440 and try again.

At the host side, the system may not be able to enumerate the Mini2440
correctly. In this case also disconnect the Mini2440, powercycle it
and connect it again.

You can check that the host was able to enumerate the Mini2440 successfully by
issuing the \texttt{lsusb} command. If the following line occurs in the list,
the Mini2440 is successfully enumerated:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
Bus 001 Device 023: ID 5345:1234 Owon PDS6062T Oscilloscope
\end{ptxshell}

Note: The bus and device number may differ in your case.

If the USB connection is up and working on both sides, we can start to push
the new bootloader into the target. This BSP comes with the required tool to do
so.

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
|\$| sudo |\ptxdistPlatformDir |sysroot-host/bin/usbpush |\ptxdistPlatformDir |images/barebox-image
\end{ptxshell}

If the transfer was successful, the \texttt{usbpush} host tool will output:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
csum = 0x74f9
send_file: addr = 0x30000000, len = 0x00024124
\end{ptxshell}

At the target side we will see:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
Now, Downloading [ADDRESS:31000000h,TOTAL:147854]
RECEIVED FILE SIZE:  147854 (144KB/S, 1S)
Downloaded file at 0x31000000, size = 147844 bytes
\end{ptxshell}

Note: The numbers shown above may be different then what you see.

After a successful transfer, we can now run the downloaded bootloader:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
Supervivi>  go 0x31000000
go to 0x31000000
  argument 0 = 0x00000000
  argument 1 = 0x00000000
  argument 2 = 0x00000000
  argument 3 = 0x00000000
\end{ptxshell}

This will start the Barebox bootloader on the Mini2440, which will
greet us with:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}

Hit any key to stop autoboot:  3
\end{ptxshell}

Stop the autoboot timeout by hitting any key. We are now in the shell
environment of Barebox. To update the NAND content in the next step we need
a working network first. One check is to show the current setting of the
network interface. You should see your own settings here, done in section
\ref{sec:networkadaptions}. Here is an example for a static network configuration:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
mini2440:/ devinfo eth0
base  : 0x00000000
size  : 0x00000000
driver: none

Parameters:
          ipaddr = 192.168.1.240
         ethaddr = 00:04:f3:00:06:35
         gateway = 192.168.1.2
         netmask = 255.255.255.0
        serverip = 192.168.1.7
\end{ptxshell}

If you do not see appropriate values here and you are using the DHCP option, run
the \texttt{dhcp} command first:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
mini2440:/ dhcp
DHCP client bound to address 192.168.1.27
\end{ptxshell}

If you do not use DHCP for network configuration, you must edit the file
\texttt{/env/config} in the Barebox environment.

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
mini2440:/ edit /env/config
\end{ptxshell}

Note: Barebox supports auto completion of commands, paths and filenames. Use
the well known TAB key.

Edit the lines beginning with \texttt{eth0.*} and give them appropriate values.
We can leave the editor by hitting CTRL-D to save our changes, or CTRL-C to
discard any change. If we want these new settings to be persistent, we can save
them now to NAND:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
mini2440:/ saveenv
\end{ptxshell}

For further explanation about the default (compiled-in) Barebox environment
and the “user defined” Barebox environment in NAND, see section \ref{sec:bbenv}.

To make the new static network configuration work, we must execute the
\texttt{config} file again:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
mini2440:/ . /env/config
\end{ptxshell}

Running the \texttt{devinfo eth0} command again should now show the values for
the network interface that you put in earlier. To check if it is really working,
try pinging other hosts:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
mini2440:/ ping 192.168.1.7
host 192.168.1.7 is alive
\end{ptxshell}

In order to store the bootloader Barebox into the NAND, we can now use
some of the builtin features in Barebox.

First we must copy - at the host side - the Barebox image from the board support
package to the directory used by the TFTP server:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
|\$| cp |\ptxdistPlatformDir |images/barebox-image /tftpboot/barebox-mini2440
\end{ptxshell}

Due to some scripts from the compiled-in environment and already setting up the
network, storing Barebox into the NAND is now very easy:

\begin{ptxshell}[escapechar=|]{^}
mini2440:/ update -t barebox -d nand
\end{ptxshell}

That's all. To boot using the new bootloader, we must now change the switch
\textbf{S2} back to the NAND position. Power cycle the Mini2440 or press its
reset button and the new bootloader will start.

After installing Barebox on the Mini2440 the hardest part is done. Now it's
time to decide about how to boot the Mini2440.

%
% Ideas:
% - Add info about how to test the Barebox written to the NAND (if it was
%   successful)
% - Add info on how to check the downloaded file is the correct one
% - maybe some comment about <erase /dev/nand0> and the use of <reset>
% - if you don't change anything using the edit command do you need to <saveenv>?  With
%   u-boot, most tutorials suggested a <saveenv>
% - What is dangerous about a <printenv>?
