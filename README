Due to massive differences in NAND flash treatment, the 64 MiB and
the non-64 MiB mini2440 have to be distinguished!

For the 64 MiB NAND mini2440 are valid:

- platformconfig-NAND-64M
- barebox-NAND-64M.config
- barebox-64m-env/

For all other non-64 MiB NAND mini2440 are valid:

- platformconfig-NAND-128M
- barebox-NAND-128M.config
- barebox-128m-env/
