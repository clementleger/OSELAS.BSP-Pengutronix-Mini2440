[ ] test not done yet
[x] test successfully done
[-] not to be done
[!] unable to do test
[f] test failes. Refer protocols/known_issues.txt

Preparations
------------

[x] make sure the following things are consistent between BSP and manual:

    [x] modules to be loaded
    [x] binaries (programs, commands)
    [x] /dev entries
    [x] mentioned files in the manual are present on the target at runtime

[x] does the manual use the same/correct file names for the archives?
[x] is the toolchain built in the way the manual mentions?
[x] does the project build in the way the manual mentions?
[x] does the project build on a 64 bit machine?
[x] does the project build on a multi core machine?

Documentation
-------------

[x] File 'documentation/plain_sources/CREDITS' honors all people working on
    this documentation
[x] The Quickstart manual lists all people working on this documentation
    according to the 'Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License'
[x] Quickstart Manual describes first steps how to setup the BSP/board

Base System
-----------

[x] bootloader is a release
[x] kernel-2.6.39.1 is a release
[x] kernel-2.6.38.8 is a release

Bootloader
----------

[x] bootloader comes up on UART0
[x] booting from NAND flash support
[x] booting from NET via TFTP support
[x] default environment comes with reasonable settings

OSELAS BSP
----------

[x] User is able to login
[x] The command "reboot" works as intended, without curious messages
[x] system reads RTC while booting
[x] NAND root partition can be mounted manually when started via NFS
[x] reboot and start from flash

Touch
-----

[x] 'ts_calibrate' is able to calibrate the touch for usage
[x] after calibration 'ts_test' must work and do "The Right Things (TM)"

Framebuffer
-----------

[x] "fbtest" runs without an error

Audio Support
-------------

[x] the platform installs a reasonable default mixer setting
[x] 'alsamixer' can control the audio mixer
[x] 'aplay' can playback various sound files at different speeds
    and mono and stereo
[x] 'madplay' plays an MP3

USB Host
--------

[x] Memory Stick:

    [x] connect usb memory stick
    [x] check if sda appears in '/proc/partitions'
    [x] check if vfat32 support is available in the kernel
    [x] mount a vfat32 from the memory stick

[-] Keyboard:

    [-] connect keyboard
    [-] check if /dev/input* appears
    [-] check with hexdump if keyboard generates keys

[-] Mouse:

    [-] connect mouse
    [-] check if /dev/input* appears
    [-] check with hexdump if mouse generates events

I2C
---

[x] I2C bus 0 is available

    [x] EEPROM is present and can be read as the manual mentioned it

SPI
---

[x] SPI bus 0 is available

    [!] no devices connect yet

UART
----

[x] three UARTs are available

    [x] "ttySAC0" as serial console
    [x] "ttySAC1" spare
    [x] "ttySAC2" spare

ADC
---

[x] can be read via the sysfs
[x] turning W1 change value on channel 1

NAND
----

[x] is working as the manual mentioned it

NOR
---

[-] not touched yet as it contains the VIVI bootloader

SD
--

[x] can be used to mount filesystems on it (ext2/vfat)

LED
---

[x] are working as the manual mentioned it

GPIO
----

[x] are working as the manual mentioned it

Network
-------

[x] works as the manual mentioned it

Keypad
------

[x] pressing K1, K2, K3, K4, K5 and K6 create input events
	20110604 jbe: K6 does not work

RTC
---

[x] is used by the kernel at boot
[x] can be read/set with the hwclock command
