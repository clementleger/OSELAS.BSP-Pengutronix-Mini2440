[ ] test not done yet
[x] test successfully done
[-] not to be done
[!] unable to do test
[f] test failes. Refer protocols/known_issues.txt

Preparations
------------

[x] make sure the following things are consistent between BSP and manual:

    [x] binaries (programs, commands)
    [x] mentioned files in the manual are present on the target at runtime

[x] does the manual use the same/correct file names for the archives?
[x] is the toolchain built in the way the manual mentions?
[x] does the project build in the way the manual mentions?
[x] does the project build on a 64 bit machine?
[x] does the project build on a multi core machine?

Documentation
-------------

[x] File 'documentation/plain_sources/CREDITS' honors all people working on
    this documentation
[x] The Quickstart manual lists all people working on this documentation
    according to the 'Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License'
[x] Quickstart Manual describes first steps how to setup the BSP/board

Base System
-----------

[x] qt4 demo is a release
    [x] rule file uses the release
[x] qml demo is a release
    [x] rule file uses the release
[x] bootloader is a release
[ ] kernel-3.9 is a release
[ ] kernel-3.8.12 is a release
[ ] kernel-3.7.10 is a release
[x] kernel-3.6.11 is a release
[x] kernel-3.5.7 is a release

[ ] kernel-3.0.77 is a release
[x] kernel-2.6.39.4 is a release
[x] kernel-2.6.38.8 is a release

Bootloader
----------

[x] bootloader comes up on UART0
[x] booting from NAND flash support without network cable plugged in
    [x] works when 'ip=none' is used as kernel parameter
[x] booting from NET via TFTP support
[x] booting from NET via NFS only (kernel and rootfs)
[x] booting from MMC/SD card without network cable plugged in
    [x] works when 'ip=none' is used as kernel parameter
[x] default environment comes with reasonable settings

OSELAS BSP
----------

[x] User is able to login
[x] The command "reboot" works as intended, without curious messages
[x] NAND root partition can be mounted manually when started via NFS
[x] SD card partition can be mounted manually when started via NFS
[x] reboot and start from flash

Touch
-----

[x] 'ts_calibrate' is able to calibrate the touchscreen for usage
[x] after calibration 'ts_test' must work and does "The Right Things (TM)"

Framebuffer
-----------

[x] "fbtest" runs without an error

Audio Support
-------------

[x] the platform installs a reasonable default mixer setting
[x] 'alsamixer' can control the audio mixer
[f] 'aplay' can playback various sound files at different speeds
    and mono and stereo
[f] 'madplay' plays an MP3

USB Host
--------

[x] Memory Stick:

    [x] connect usb memory stick
    [x] check if sda appears in '/proc/partitions'
    [x] check if vfat32 support is available in the kernel
    [x] mount a vfat32 from the memory stick

[-] Keyboard:

    [-] connect keyboard
    [-] check if /dev/input* appears
    [-] check with hexdump if keyboard generates keys

[x] Mouse:

    [x] connect mouse
    [x] check if /dev/input* appears
    [x] check with evtest if device generates events
    [x] this device should not confuse udev (links to the touchscreen driver)

USB Device
----------

[-] acting as a serial USB device

[-] acting as a printer USB device

I2C
---

[x] I2C bus 0 is available

    [x] EEPROM is present and can be read as the manual mentioned it

SPI
---

[!] SPI bus 0 is available

    [!] no devices connect yet

UART
----

[x] three UARTs are available

    [x] "ttySAC0" as serial console
    [x] "ttySAC1" spare
    [x] "ttySAC2" spare

ADC
---

[x] can be read via the sysfs
[x] turning W1 change value on channel 1

NAND
----

[x] is working as the manual mentioned it

NOR
---

[-] not touched yet as it contains the VIVI bootloader

SD
--

[x] can be used to mount filesystems on it (ext2/vfat)

LED
---

[x] are working as the manual mentioned it

GPIO
----

[x] are working as the manual mentioned it

Network
-------

[x] works as the manual mentioned it

Keypad
------

[x] pressing K1, K2, K3, K4, K5 and K6 create input events

RTC
---

[x] is used by the kernel at boot
[x] can be read/set with the hwclock command

Buzzer
------

[x] makes noise as expected
