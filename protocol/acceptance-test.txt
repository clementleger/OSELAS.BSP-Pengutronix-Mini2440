Customer:       OSELAS.Community
Project:        FriendlyARM, Mini2440

Legend
------

[ ] test not done yet
[x] test successfully done
[-] not to be done
[!] unable to do test
[f] test failes. Refer protocols/known_issues.txt

Preparations
------------

[ ] make sure the following things are consistent between BSP and manual:

    [ ] modules to be loaded
    [ ] binaries (programs, commands)
    [ ] /dev entries
    [ ] mentioned files in the manual are present on the target at runtime

[ ] does the manual use the same/right file names for the archives?
[ ] is the toolchain built in the way the manual mentions?
[ ] does the project build in the way the manual mentions?

Base System
-----------

[ ] bootloader is a release
[ ] kernel-2.6.39 is a release
[ ] kernel-2.6.38.7 is a release

Bootloader
----------

[ ] bootloader comes up on UART0
[ ] booting from NAND flash support
[ ] booting from NET via TFTP support
[ ] default environment comes with reasonable settings

OSELAS BSP
----------

[ ] User is able to login
[ ] Quickstart Manual describes first steps how to setup the board
[ ] The command "reboot" works as intended, without curious messages
[ ] system reads RTC while booting
[ ] NAND root partition can be mounted manually when started via NFS
[ ] reboot and start from flash
[ ] test if we can mount partitions via nfs

Touch
-----

[ ] 'ts_calibrate' is able to calibrate the touch for usage
[ ] after calibration 'ts_test' must work and do "The Right Things (TM)"

Framebuffer - Final Scenario
----------------------------

[ ] "fbtest" runs without an error

Audio Support
-------------

[ ] aplay can playback various sound files at different speeds
    and mono and stereo
[ ] alsamixer can control the audio mixer

USB Host
--------

[ ] Memory Stick:

    [ ] connect usb memory stick
    [ ] check if sda appears in '/proc/partitions'
    [ ] {,s,c}fdisk - create partition (find out how)
    [ ] check if vfat32 support is available in the kernel
    [ ] mkfs.vfat: create partition (-F32 for vfat32)

[-] Keyboard:

    [-] connect keyboard
    [-] check if /dev/input* appears
    [-] check with hexdump if keyboard generates keys

[-] Mouse:

    [-] connect mouse
    [-] check if /dev/input* appears
    [-] check with hexdump if mouse generates events

I2C
---

[ ] I2C bus 0 is available

    [ ] EEPROM is present and can be read

SPI
---

[ ] SPI bus 0 is available

    [!] no devices connect yet

UART
----

[ ] three UARTs are available

    [ ] "ttySAC0" as serial console
    [ ] "ttySAC1" spare
    [ ] "ttySAC2" spare
