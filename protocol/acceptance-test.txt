[ ] test not done yet
[x] test successfully done
[-] not to be done
[!] unable to do test
[f] test failes. Refer protocols/known_issues.txt

Preparations
------------

[ ] make sure the following things are consistent between BSP and manual:

    [-] modules to be loaded
    [ ] binaries (programs, commands)
    [ ] /dev entries
    [ ] mentioned files in the manual are present on the target at runtime

[ ] does the manual use the same/correct file names for the archives?
[ ] is the toolchain built in the way the manual mentions?
[ ] does the project build in the way the manual mentions?
[ ] does the project build on a 64 bit machine?
[ ] does the project build on a multi core machine?

Documentation
-------------

[ ] File 'documentation/plain_sources/CREDITS' honors all people working on
    this documentation
[ ] The Quickstart manual lists all people working on this documentation
    according to the 'Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License'
[ ] Quickstart Manual describes first steps how to setup the BSP/board

Base System
-----------

[ ] bootloader is a release
[ ] kernel-3.0.4 is a release
[ ] kernel-2.6.39.4 is a release
[ ] kernel-2.6.38.8 is a release

Bootloader
----------

[ ] bootloader comes up on UART0
[ ] booting from NAND flash support
[ ] booting from NET via TFTP support
[ ] booting from MMC/SD card
[ ] default environment comes with reasonable settings

OSELAS BSP
----------

[ ] User is able to login
[ ] The command "reboot" works as intended, without curious messages
[ ] system reads RTC while booting
[ ] NAND root partition can be mounted manually when started via NFS
[ ] reboot and start from flash

Touch
-----

[ ] 'ts_calibrate' is able to calibrate the touchscreen for usage
[ ] after calibration 'ts_test' must work and does "The Right Things (TM)"

Framebuffer
-----------

[ ] "fbtest" runs without an error

Audio Support
-------------

[ ] the platform installs a reasonable default mixer setting
[ ] 'alsamixer' can control the audio mixer
[ ] 'aplay' can playback various sound files at different speeds
    and mono and stereo
[ ] 'madplay' plays an MP3

USB Host
--------

[ ] Memory Stick:

    [ ] connect usb memory stick
    [ ] check if sda appears in '/proc/partitions'
    [ ] check if vfat32 support is available in the kernel
    [ ] mount a vfat32 from the memory stick

[-] Keyboard:

    [-] connect keyboard
    [-] check if /dev/input* appears
    [-] check with hexdump if keyboard generates keys

[-] Mouse:

    [-] connect mouse
    [-] check if /dev/input* appears
    [-] check with hexdump if mouse generates events

USB Device
----------

[-] acting as a serial USB device

[-] acting as a printer USB device

I2C
---

[ ] I2C bus 0 is available

    [ ] EEPROM is present and can be read as the manual mentioned it

SPI
---

[ ] SPI bus 0 is available

    [!] no devices connect yet

UART
----

[ ] three UARTs are available

    [ ] "ttySAC0" as serial console
    [ ] "ttySAC1" spare
    [ ] "ttySAC2" spare

ADC
---

[ ] can be read via the sysfs
[ ] turning W1 change value on channel 1

NAND
----

[ ] is working as the manual mentioned it

NOR
---

[-] not touched yet as it contains the VIVI bootloader

SD
--

[ ] can be used to mount filesystems on it (ext2/vfat)

LED
---

[ ] are working as the manual mentioned it

GPIO
----

[ ] are working as the manual mentioned it

Network
-------

[ ] works as the manual mentioned it

Keypad
------

[ ] pressing K1, K2, K3, K4, K5 and K6 create input events
	20110907 jbe: K6 still does not work

RTC
---

[ ] is used by the kernel at boot
[ ] can be read/set with the hwclock command
